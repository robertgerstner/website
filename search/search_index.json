Here, I developed my passion for science and my overall motivation to succeed academically. I was then lucky enough to receive a scholarship to study at Western University in London, ON. I chose the Integrated Science program because it allowed me to be exposed to all areas of science and how they interconnect with each other and with society at large. It also allowed me to simultaneously pursue a specialization in any scientific discipline, of which I chose physics due to its ability to fuel my curiosity as well as my mathematical inclinations. </p> <p>I later became fascinated by quantum mechanics, and in particular, quantum computing. The way that counterintuitive quantum phenomena such as superposition and entanglement could be harnessed for a potentially revolutionary technology was incredibly intriguing to me. I began to immerse myself in the field. Later, I was introduced to condensed matter physics, where quantum mechanics is applied to study materials and their properties. One thing I love about condensed matter is its versatility; the work ranges from abstract mathematical theory all the way to practical real-world applications. I spent two summers with Prof. Jesko Sirker at the University of Manitoba where we studied the phenomenon of many-body localization (or the lack thereof... see here for more information). In addition, I spent a year with Prof. Mahi Singh at Western where I was introduced to the field of plasmonics. This all led me to pursue a Master of Science degree at McGill University in theoretical condensed matter physics with Prof. Bill Coish, where I currently reside. After the completion of my MSc, I plan to pursue a PhD degree and hopefully become a research scientist in computational/theoretical physics.</p>"},{"location":"about/#education","title":"Education","text":"Year Degree Institution Location 2024-Present Master of Science McGill University Montr\u00e9al, QC, Canada 2020-2024 Bachelor of Science Western University London, ON, Canada"},{"location":"about/#relevant-research-skills","title":"Relevant Research Skills","text":"<ul> <li>Python, Julia, Mathematica, Maple, C++, LaTex, Git/GitHub</li> <li>Deep learning (basics)</li> <li>Quantum mechanics (advanced)</li> <li>Computational physics techniques: neural quantum states</li> </ul>"},{"location":"about/#other-interests","title":"Other Interests","text":"My beautiful dog, Gracie. <p>When not at the office, there's a good chance you'll find me at the track.

Source.      An illustration of phase matching, a requirement for efficient SHG, from my simulations. <p>The invention of the laser led to the revolutionary discovery of nonlinear optics, characterized by a nonlinear relationship between the response of a material and its incident electric field. High harmonic generation is a nonlinear effect whereby a nonlinear medium such as a crystal or nanoparticle interacts with a monochromatic coherent incident wave and emits a frequency-multiplied coherent wave. For example, in second (third) harmonic generation, or SHG (THG), the frequency is doubled (tripled). This process is the source of numerous applications and phenomena of interest, from biological sensing and microscopy to Raman and Brillouin scattering. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the use of metallic nanohybrids, nanostructures made of multiple metallic species, as an avenue for exploring how signals of harmonic generation can be enhanced by plasmonic properties. In particular, these materials possess localized surface plasmon resonances, which allow for strongly enhanced local electric fields and thus enhanced high harmonic generation. </p> <p>This project aimed to develop a theory for second and third harmonic generation in metallic nanohybrids that are plasmonic multilayer films of gold, aluminum, and copper sulfied nanoparticles. The theory uses surface plasmon polaritons and the dipole-dipole interaction to explain enhancement of harmonic generation in these materials. </p>"},{"location":"research/highlights/Harm_Gen/#more-information","title":"More Information","text":"CAP Congress, May 27/30 2024. <p>I was involved with this project as an undergraduate honours thesis student with Prof. Mahi Singh at Western University.

This phenomeon has become known as Anderson localization. Ever since this result, an open question has remained of whether such localization survives in a many-particle system with interactions: does many-body localization (MBL) exist? If such a phenomenon persisted in the thermodynamic limit, it would go against our normal understanding in statistical mechanics that all systems thermalize. Further, it would imply that the system retains a memory of its initial conditions, allowing for a form of quantum memory.</p> <p>Many scientists have used perturbative and numerical arguments in favour of MBL, and many have studied the MBL transition (at what disorder strength does a system become localized). Published in 2016, Imbrie attempted to provide a proof of MBL for a one-dimensional spin chain, using the mixed-field Ising model with random couplings. However, there has recently been a growing body of evidence that MBL does not exist, and our intuitive notion of thermalization indeed prevails. Our research project contributes to this body of evidence, perhaps most strongly.</p> <p>In particular, we attacked the problem from a new angle by studying the growth and spreading of local operators under Heisenberg time evolution rather than the evolution of wave functions themselves. We used this to develop benchmarks for localization based on operator norm bounds and the spatial support around the lattice. We find that a representation of the Hamiltonian as an effective form in terms of local conserved charges with terms exponentially suppressed with their length, which is expected for an MBL phase, is likely not possible. Please see our paper for more details. The paper, which primarily covers the Heisenberg model, is currently undergoing revisions. More results involving the mixed-field Ising model will come out soon. </p>"},{"location":"research/highlights/MBL/#more-information","title":"More Information","text":"University of Manitoba, Aug. 17 2023. <p>I was involved in this project as a summer student with Prof. Jesko Sirker at the University of Manitoba in 2023, continuing part-time until Jan. 2024.
