# About Me

<img src="./home_media/headshot1.jpg" alt="Headshot1" style="height:420px; width:300px; float:left; margin-right:15px;margin-bottom:15px;"> 

I am a first-year Master's student in the Department of Physics at McGill University supervised by Prof. [Bill Coish](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~coish/). I am interested in harnessing computational tools such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing for scientific advancement, with my current focus being on quantum many-body physics. I hope to pursue a PhD degree after the completion of my MSc.

I can be reached via email at [robert.gerstner@mail.mcgill.ca](mailto:robert.gerstner@mail.mcgill.ca), and my CV can be found [here](./home_media/CV_June_2025.pdf).

## Publications

-**[2025-06-05]** My new paper coming out of my undergraduate thesis work with Prof. [Mahi Singh](https://physics.uwo.ca/~msingh/), in collaboration with Prof. [Richard Haglund]'s group at Vanderbilt University, and completed by my collaborator Qingzhou Meng after my departure, is now available [online](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/richardhaglund/) as an accepted manuscript by Physica Scripta.

- **[2025-02-10]** A significantly updated version of our many-body localization (MBL) manuscript is now on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031). We now believe we have strong analytical evidence for a lack of MBL in the disordered Heisenberg and mixed-field Ising models, and open a new avenue towards further studies of MBL via operator growth.

- **[2024-12-19]** My mini research project studying arbitrary one-dimensional periodic materials with graph theory is available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15107).

- **[2024-01-16]** My first paper, coming out of my work with Prof. [Jesko Sirker](http://drop.physics.umanitoba.ca/~jsirker/Dokuwiki/doku.php?id=home) in collaboration with Dr. [Alexander Weisse](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/weisse/), is now on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031)! We study localization in the Heisenberg model through the novel lens of operator growth, finding strong evidence for a lack of many-body localization.
